Following the impromptu celebration of Shuri's latest creation, she was called into the Sect Leader's office the very next morning. Shuri moved towards her destination with a jolly skip in her steps, as the elation from the night before still clung to her. After all, she'd achieved two successes - a revolutionary Automagic creation as well as an advancement in her cultivation.

She wasn't sure why she was being called to the Sect Leader's office, and that too with such a formal invite. As a letter had been delivered to her doorstep with highly formal language saying that they would have to, "Discuss the future of the new Intellectual Property and its inclusion in the Sect's vast portfolio."

In truth, Shuri didn't know what to do with the Magi-Core. It was a product with immense potential and could shake the magic landscape for years to come. BUT with great power comes an equally great amount of scrutiny. A ripple this big would attract the big fish in the sea, and if they sensed even a droplet of blood, Shuri anticipated a ruthless feeding frenzy. Where would she fall into this equation?

Needless to say, the upcoming meeting will answer that question as well. What was the Sect Leader going to do with such a double-edged asset?

"We won't be mass-producing this and selling this in the market," the Sect Leader declared decisively. Shuri was sitting opposite him, with Markus, Marie and Furion beside her.

"There is potential for great profit here," Furion pointed out. "It also offers the VTC to branch out its investments-"

"The Magi-Core is a weapon," Markus interjected. "The VTC does not ply in that trade, Furion."

The hefty and increasingly orange-skinned boy shrugged and said, "I believe it is a matter of eventuality. We have expanded roots into every possible industry in some shape or form. The weaponry and defence field is the only segment of the market where we are going through third parties."

At that moment, the Sect Leader raised his palms and said, "It isn't a matter of eventuality. I am avoiding that market segment on purpose, even though it is highly profitable to do so. It doesn't align with our Sect's values."

"Though I would like to point out that the Magi-Core is more of a support structure for the visually impaired. It is just like a tool to help them, is it not?" Furion reasoned.

"A tool to build can turn into a tool to destroy depending on how you use it," the Sect Leader countered. "We see the Magi-Core in a positive light because it offers an avenue for growth, for a group of people who have been suppressed and denied a normal opportunity. However, the Magi-Core has uses that go beyond just that - you know it, I know it, and I don't believe others won't be able to put one-and-one together and learn of it as well."

The Sect Leader poured a cup of tea for everyone present while expounding, "I believe it has come time for us to discuss the ethics behind controlling what we know and what we allow others to know. All this while, I have been teaching that knowledge must be shared and that hoarding knowledge is antithetical to its purpose."

He revealed a bitter smile and said, "I probably come across as a hypocrite for saying this after all that."

"Not at all, Master!" Markus denied animatedly.

"Oh, please!" Marie shot back. "In your eyes, your Master can do no wrong."

"My belief hasn't failed me till now," Markus argued.

"Enough, you two!" Sect Leader Larks cut the argument decisively. "Marie is right in voicing her scepticism. But I am sure she is doing so only out of benefit for the others present. She knows better than anyone just how devastating certain knowledge can be when handed to people who lack the conscientiousness and expertise to properly use it."

"The Magi-Core is dangerous in the hands of those who aren't initiated to our line of thought," Shuri spoke up. "Otherwise the Magic Wand would also be commercialised."

"Exactly!" The Sect Leader agreed with a snap of his fingers. "When you create a product, you often have a vision of how it should be used. People can use a spoon to bolt a door, doesn't mean they should."

"But if it's effective..." Marie mumbled off to the side.

"But that is a mild example. A shield is used to block against attackers, but it also has the potential to bash someone's head in. Is that its purpose in life? No. But can it achieve its objective? Definitely, sometimes even more efficiently than a mace whose express purpose in life IS to bash people's skulls into a paste," the Sect Leader said with a scoff. "With that said, I don't want my 'shield' to become a skull-basher. I would prefer if I had control over the narrative, to put it differently."

He then turned to Shuri and said with a serious frown, "Which is why I request that Shuri hand over the rights to this intellectual property to the Sect."

This caused the mood in the room to sour markedly.

"But Master, this sets a precedent-"

"Let it!" The Sect Leader emphasised with a resolute glare. "If anyone else develops weapons then all rights to it will be appropriated by the Sect."

"That's a lot of power for one person," Marie reminded. "You are asking us to just trust you and take your word for it."

"The Sect isn't just me," the Sect Leader reminded. "The Sect's by-laws dictate that any big decision that has the ability to affect the Sect's direction will be put through an anonymous vote, with the pool consisting of every one thoroughly informed of the problem. I move for this precedent to be put to a vote, the result of which will then determine how to move forward with the dissemination of the Magi-Core."

"But Jean isn't here," Markus pointed out worriedly.

"Doesn't matter, we have a quorum," Marie cut him off. "I second this move. Let us vote on it."

"Don't I get a say in this?" Shuri spoke up. "I mean, I am one of the concerned stakeholders here. I am the one who designed and created the Magi-Core. I am the one who will have to eventually make them too. If the Sect does appropriate my IP, then I will be forced to create these things against my will."

"Not really," the Sect Leader answered. "If you don't want to make anymore, that is perfectly fine. I can't force you- WE can't force you to do anything."

Then with a sigh, he added, "But if the Sect does gain the rights to your IP, we will stop you from making and distributing Magi-Cores without approval."

"What if the Sect doesn't gain the rights? What if the vote is not in favour of appropriation?" Shuri challenged.

To that, the Sect Leader shrugged and admitted, "Then there is nothing else I can do apart from imploring your morality - your sense of right and wrong - and trying to convince you on a personal level."

"Why aren't we starting with that first, then?" Shuri shot back with an affronted look on her face.

"Because then it would be considered emotional manipulation and abuse of power," the Sect Leader said to justify his actions. "The official channel is impersonal. If the decision succeeds, then great. If the decision falls through, so be it."

"I still don't like it," Shuri admitted. "I was promised autonomy, but this would effectively steal that away from me."

There was silence in the room as the Sect Leader's gaze drilled down on Shuri.

"I won't justify my decision by saying that I am doing it for your own good," the Sect Leader said, breaking the tense silence. "Maybe in a few years, when you see the death toll the proliferation of the tool you created has wrought your mind will change. You may feel deeply conflicted, thinking that all that blood is on your hands. Maybe you won't, saying that once it is out there it is the decision of the user and not the creator."

He leaned back, looked towards the ceiling and continued, "I don't want people to die unnecessary deaths. And I don't want you to be consumed by guilt either. So I am proceeding down this path, even if it is wrong, goes against my earlier words, or hurts you. You are free to hate me for it. And if you do come to the same realisation later on, I don't need you to thank me for it either."

Shuri furrowed her brows before getting up and leaving the room. She did feel hurt, but she also understood where the Sect Leader was coming from. She agreed with his analysis but was equally conflicted that it came with the cost of her autonomy in this matter.

"I should go talk to her-" Markus said as he tried to get up.

"Let her work through this on her own," Marie stopped him by placing a forceful hand on his shoulder. "Currently, her pride and sensibility are in emotional conflict. But, Shuri is more sensible than she is prideful, so she'll come back to it eventually."

"But she is still upset," Markus said while pulling his lips into a thin line, concerned. He then pushed away Marie's hand and left the room as well.

"So, what should I do?" Furion said, finally. "I hope I wasn't called here to sit through a pointless spat."

"I need you to use your marketing channels to find more members for the Sect," Sect Leader Larks answered with a business-like tone. "Focus only on teenagers of recruitment age who are visually impaired."

"Oh?" Furion acknowledged with a cock of his brows.

"No matter the outcome of the vote, the opportunities afforded by the Magi-Core will be reaped," Sect Leader Larks affirmed. "I only want five new members for the time being. And try to get them from all walks of life, not just the financially underprivileged."

"I shall make it so," Furion declared before standing up, bowing, and leaving.

Then, there was just Marie and the Sect Leader alone in the room.

"You have anything to say," the Sect Leader probed.

Marie closed her eyes for a few minutes, before saying, "Matron Reva is in a mood today, so I wouldn't annoy her."

"She's always in a mood," Sect Leader Larks groaned.

"That's not true," Marie denied. "Before you came, she was pretty bland."

"So you're saying that I'm the problem?"

"If it quacks like a duck and waddles like one... I mean, I don't even need to use the Heavenly Eye to answer that question!" Marie mocked before getting up and leaving as well.

As she was just about to leave the ear, she heard the man grumble, "Damn it! I really could use some cake right now..."
