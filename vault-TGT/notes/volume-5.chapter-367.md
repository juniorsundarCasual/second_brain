The Sect Leader was unusually animated these days. It all started from the day the seven rule-breakers were called in for fighting amongst themselves. That day marked the first time everyone in the Sect truly saw the Sect Leader's furious expression. Usually, the man was a pillar of tranquillity and nigh-infinite patience. But that day, they saw a different expression blooming on the man's mien. People often say that it is the one who smiles and projects an outwardly unperturbed aura that is the scariest when angered. The commotion that day proved that idiom true.

A booming voice yelled, "Stop this farce this instant!"

The dust cloud caused by the tussling teens on the ground dispersed almost instantly, revealing the ragged and bruised septet. The twins had ganged up on Krane, with Casey sitting on his chest and Lacey holding down his legs. Kevan and Norris were in a slapping match, which was largely pointless as they were standing beyond the slapping distance. Revian had a fistful of Luce's hair in his hands, while she had him in a chokehold. The loud reprimand, however, put a halt to the childish fight, and the observing crowd split down the middle to reveal the enraged Sect Leader.

The man's eyeballs were practically popping out of their sockets and were dyed an angry red as their veins bulged out. His expression had warped significantly from the usual serene smile, revealing a more dangerous dour frown. He walked forward with heavy steps as he approached the miscreants.

"What is all this?" He asked forcefully, gesturing at the ruckus the seven had caused. He then turned to the gawking audience and said, "Do you lot have nothing better to do?!"

The crowd dissipated instantaneously, lest the Sect Leader's overflowing anger redirect their way.

"You seven!" He said. His gaze pierced into the souls of the seven before him. "I want you to clean yourselves this instant and come to the administrative office immediately after. If I hear from anyone about you guys causing any more trouble-"

He did not finish the sentence. He did not need to finish that sentence. The sentence basically finished itself.

The Sect Leader did not waste another second and left the scene, which was immediately mimicked by the seven pugilists who disappeared so quickly that one could practically still see their outlines standing in place.

Markus was not amidst the crowd, and he only heard about it the next day, early in the morning, when the seven transgressors were paraded atop the stage at the Sect's assembly hall and made to read out a written apology in front of everyone.

It was a sombre event, where some readers even broke down into tears (the twins and Krane in particular). It definitely left a mark in the minds of all those present at and observing the gruesome emotional dressing down, and emphasised just what awaited rule breakers in the True World Sect. There was something truly visceral about having one's weaknesses and mistakes placed on display, and that too straight from the person themselves. And it opened the eyes of everyone in the Sect to the fact that there is a limit to the Sect Leader's patience. And that behind the jovial visage of the man who celebrates every achievement made by a member with pomp and splendour lies a sadistic beast who can just as (if not more) easily break them down. Thankfully, the beast lies dormant - one just shouldn't be stupid enough to poke it like the seven just did.

After it, though, Markus' Master stepped forth and hugged every confessor and gently talked them offstage. He then took centre stage and addressed the crowd with a severe tone.

"Let it be known that the Sect does not tolerate unsanctioned violence of any sort," he projected. "We follow a strict one-strike policy, wherein the first infarction is the last infarction."

He let the words hang in the air for the members to digest their implications.

"The only reason why the seven haven't been expelled is because both sides - the aggressors and the victims - shook hands with the former apologising to the latter, following which they broadcasted the error of their ways to the rest of the Sect," he appended. "Do not think this to be a loophole - that simply apologising will get you out of trouble. The victim must be willing to accept the apology as well!"

There was silence once again, but Markus could hear a few people swallowing dry mouthfuls of air in trepidation.

But suddenly, the anger in his Master's face disappeared, returning to the usual smile. But it kept growing wider... and wider; there is a point where a sincere smile turns demonic, and his Master had blown past that limit.

"Since everyone's gathered here," his Master started with an ecstatic grin. "We will be holding another gathering with mandatory attendance in a week in Lecture Hall C. This is just a heads-up notification, so keep your schedules free."

And with that, he dismounted from the stage and fled the scene like some common cutpurse. Markus, and everyone else, were dumbfounded by his Master's sudden reversal. They were still reeling from the dour process from before.

"What's this about?" Markus asked Marie who was standing on his left.

"Why are you asking me? You're his Disciple!" Marie snapped back derisively.

"Our meetings aren't as frequent as before now that Master has so many responsibilities," Markus admitted with a bitter smile. He then glared at her and retorted, "Are you still prohibited from scrying the future?"

Marie shrugged and started walking away, leaving him with Shuri who was deep in thought.

"Do YOU have any ideas?" Markus tried less hopefully.

Shuri pulled her lips in and shook her head disappointedly.

Luckily for Markus, he didn't have to wait for long for the reason to his Master's excitement to become known. Within two days, a booklet was circulated amongst all members.

"Structured Debate: Primer"

"It seems Master is trying to facilitate a more constructive argumentation process," Markus commented out loud while flipping through the short document.

At that moment, Shuri walked over and tapped his shoulder, "The Sect Leader is calling you?"

"Me?" Markus parroted agitatedly. 

Shuri clicked her tongue and said, "You, amongst others."

"Oh... Who else?"

"Marie was told to bring her Master as well, so if I were to venture a guess, everyone present in and above the Foundation Establishment realm," Shuri responded while walking briskly towards the Sect Leader's office.

She arrived just as Marie and her Master hobbled over. As she was about to knock on the door, the older man slid past and pushed open the door.

"When I decided to become an Elder in this Sect, I didn't actually think I would have things to do, Guy," Elder Nara said while plopping the booklet on the Sect Leader's table. "So what's this all about."

The Sect Leader looked past the Tesseract Transformation realm mage and gestured for Shuri and the rest to also take a seat.

"I'd prefer if Jean were here too," the Sect Leader said regretfully, "But she'll get her chance later. You see, I need you guys to help me out."

"Does it have something to do with this debate business?" Elder Nara interjected.

"Precisely so, I need you guys to be the judges for the upcoming debate," the Sect Leader revealed. "Don't worry, it's nothing too difficult. All you have to do is listen to the arguments, counterarguments and rebuttals, and decide on which side was more substantial."

"Why are we doing this," Elder Nara questioned.

"Kids are naturally argumentative. You saw what happened with Revian and the rest," the Sect Leader reasoned. "We need to provide them with a constructive outlet."

Elder Nara shrugged and said, "Just let them fight it out. You do realise that a Sect cultivates weapons of mass destruction. By putting a leash on them like this, you are only adding to the growing pressure. One day it will explode and when it does..."

"You underestimate the release a well-crafted and heated debate offers," the Sect Leader rebutted with a smirk. "Violence is just violence. You don't gain anything from it. To win through violence is to win by default - just because your competitors are incapable of participating. It makes you more rigid and inflexible to change. But a structured debate is different. It cultivates a more open mind capable of evaluating varied thoughts. It builds character!"

The Sect Leader rose from his seat and spread his arms outwards majestically.

"Structured debates teach you to be organized. They force you to think critically. They encourage you to research. They motivate you to speak effectively to a diverse audience, and thus build your communication skills. In the process, they also build your confidence. The debate format urges you to be an effective listener, understand different perspectives, and resolve conflict effectively. It encourages structured thinking and improves functional retention of knowledge. Finally, a good debater is a good persuader!" The Sect Leader orated. Shuri was certain a golden halo bloomed from behind the man for just a moment."

"All of these skills are fairly pointless in real life, Guy," Elder Nara highlighted. "What use is confidence when you are forced to face an encroaching sword?"

"If the opponent has to raise their sword, they've already lost," the Sect Leader rebutted. "And if it gets to that point, I'm confident my Sect members are capable enough to hold their own."

"That's some confidence," Elder Nara said with a faint smile. "Alright, I'll humour you this time. But let's not make my participation a regular thing, shall we?"

"I'm sure you'll take back your words very soon," the Sect Leader said mysteriously.

"Do we get to prepare for the topic?" Markus interjected with his doubt.

"I'll be handing out the reports written by both the groups for your reference. Take your time to read through it, and take notes. You will have the liberty to ask questions after the debate to clarify any details," Sect Leader Larks explained.

He then clapped his hands and chirped, "It's going to be so exciting! Trust me!"
