While Al was experimenting, Markus was taking down notes on the workbook according to his observations. 

In this world, the field of education had stagnated significantly. While there were courses on basic arithmetics, arts, civics, literature, and philosophy, there wasn’t any field similar to science from Guy’s old world.

The only “technology” that was in this world was tied intimately with magic and mana. These included magical engineering, enchanting, and alchemy to name a few.

So when Markus was exposed to this fascinating new world of science, he was immediately taken with it. Everything made sense. And things that didn’t make sense could be verified by simple tests and experiments.

On top of that, one didn’t need to have a profound cultivation realm to get involved in it! Compared to the almost nonsensical cultivation mantras he read through before, this was more coherent.

Al and Guy both observed the excitement with which Markus filled in the workbook.

Al reached into his storage disk and retrieved a badge with a symbol of an open book on it. He handed it to Markus.

Markus jolted in his seat and quickly shook his hand, “Sir! I cannot accept your seal as I already have a master.”

Al patted Markus on his shoulder and instructed, “Relax. I assume that you will need access to the Academy’s alchemy lab to conduct most of the experiments in this book. Show this seal to the caretaker, and he’ll let you in. You can also check out items under my name.”

Markus’ eyes widened in excitement. He turned towards his master to ask for permission. Guy couldn’t bring himself to say no in front of those pleading eyes, so he nodded in affirmation.

Markus carefully pocketed the badge and continued filling in the information in his workbook.

Guy diverted his attention to the mana-powered clock at the back of the library and nearly jolted in his seat.

“Markus we need to go! We need to check in with my Supervisor, Teacher Hinds.”

Markus carefully closed the workbook and packed up his stationery. The two then briskly walked towards Blevin Hinds’ office.

An academy's fame and prestige was directly correlated to the number of accomplished teachers that were in its employ. More specifically, it depended on the number of teachers with starred licenses. 

In Gaea, individuals with licensed certificates in particular professions are valued highly. It is a direct indicator of how proficient they are in that singular field. Of them, the teaching license holds the highest position. This is because the metaphorical distance between levels of a teaching license is exponential, as opposed to other professions where it is mostly linear. A 2-star teacher must hold 2-star licenses in two different professions. Similarly, a 3-star teacher must have 3-star licenses in three different professions.

While Blevin had secured a position as a teacher in Radiant Academy, he was not an officially certified one. In fact, he was currently working towards a 1-star enchanting license so that he could finally become eligible to apply for a 1-star teaching license.

To academies, teachers such as Blevin Hinds were considered promising investments. Whenever an employed teacher showed potential, the academies would sink more resources into nurturing them and pushing them forward in their careers.

Once these talents achieved their starred teaching licenses, they would inevitably raise the value of the schools they were employed in.

Sure, it was a possibility that the newly licensed teachers would leave their current academy. But that rarely happened because they would subconsciously feel a sense of gratitude to the academy for supporting them.

This was one of the ways academies retained talents. As opposed to hiring externally, organic growth was sustainable. Additionally, as academies grew in fame, more accomplished teachers would be drawn towards it, since an increase in fame and power would correspond to growth in wealth and access to rarer resources.

As of now, Guy wasn't sure of what he wanted to achieve in this world. His motivation was to teach, but he couldn't decide whether he should work towards a teaching license. As a new migrant into this world, he was still trying to figure things out and he didn't want to make any hasty decisions.

'One step at a time,' he told himself while knocking at Teacher Hinds' office door.

An affirming grunt resounded from the other end. This was how Blevin usually indicated for visitors to enter. Blevin didn't know whether the visitors were of a higher position, or if they were below him. But he grunted nonetheless. Apparently, his arrogance didn't discriminate. Guy kind of respected that...

Guy slowly opened the door and performed a salutation offered to individuals of a higher stature by bowing in a light thirty-degree angle.

The room was moderately sized. There was a desk for the occupant at the back of the room, and right next to the entrance there was a table with a few seats next to it, to hold impromptu meetings.

Not all teachers in the academy could enjoy the luxury of having an individual room. This mere detail spoke volumes of how valuable Blevin was for the Radiant Academy. It was highly unusual for a 21-year-old Foundation Establishment mage to qualify for a teaching position. There were usually multiple stringent tests following the teaching apprenticeship that evaluated the basics of cultivation.

Most individuals would extend their apprenticeship for a few more years just to gain more knowledge and broaden their horizons. Ultimately, the average age of earning a teaching position was 25 to 27-years-old.

"Larks? Why're you here?" Blevin remarked curtly. Clearly, he wasn't pleased to see Guy. To Blevin, apart from Mai Louts, his other two apprentices were eyesores. He could tolerate Guy, but he simply hated the guts on Jo Way!

"We were supposed to check in today to track our student's progress," Guy reminded him.

Blevin scratched his head while wearing an annoyed expression. He flipped through a book on his table to verify. Once he found the entry for today's date, he clicked his tongue and scrunched his face.

He then pointed at a table near the entrance. Guy and Markus respectfully sat down around the table and waited for the meeting to begin.

Not a minute later, another knock was heard from the door, to which Blevin unleashed his standard grunt. The door opened with a confident swing, and a familiar woman stepped in.

The frown on Blevin's face evaporated instantaneously.

"Apprentice Louts! You're right on time. Please take a seat," he said with a sweet intonation.

Although he was ogling at the woman's near impeccable face, he failed to observe the clear displeasure rendered on it.

Mai strutted towards the table and pulled out a seat opposite Guy and sat down. A student that looked like a spiritual carbon copy of Mai strode in arrogantly and sat down beside her teacher.

Markus nodded his head to greet the student, but the girl snorted and turned her head perfunctorily.

Markus lowered his head in embarrassment. He criticised himself internally for reaching out. After basking in the open and jovial environment cultivated by his Master, he had forgotten the cruel indifference of the world around him.

Guy shook his head and patted Markus' shoulders. He had also observed the interaction between his and Mai's students. Although as a modern teacher he was inclined to reach across the aisle and instruct the girl to be more accomodating of people, he held himself back. This world didn't consider bullying to be detrimental to student health. It actually encouraged such "friendly rivalry".

While he knew that to others, such behaviour was acceptable and a natural course in a student's life, Guy was not willing to budge on his stance on bullying. He sincerely wanted to seek retribution for Markus, but his logic prevailed and held him back. He knew that as a grunt in society, he didn't have any power or hold any influence. He could only swallow his grievance and support his student emotionally.

Meanwhile, Blevin finished his tasks and walked towards the meeting table, with a wooden box in his hands. He gently placed the box on the table and sat down close to Mai.

Mai wore a pleasing smile but slowly nudged her seat away from Blevin. Her face and body language spoke two different things. She was disgusted by Blevin's blatant toadying, but she could only swallow her disgust and ingratiate herself to the man. He was her superior after all.

This was another thing that irked Guy. As a man, he recognised his privilege. Even in this world, where both genders potentially have the opportunity to stand equally as mages, men had a distinct advantage. The issue was not related to physical strength, but mental and emotional conditioning. As this world was still in the dark ages, women were conditioned from a young age to be submissive. Even with the power to overturn the universe, the goddess immortal would subconsciously act reservedly to a male opponent of equal strength.

So presently, Guy could only watch as Blevin started to get handsy with Mai, who was fidgeting in discomfort.

What surprised Guy, though, was that they were completely ignoring him and Markus. It was as if they were invisible.

Guy coughed audibly and still didn't receive any reaction.

'Hey, Mast! Is there some kind of an occluding ritual or spell in motion?'

(Nope. They just don't care about you,) Mast replied.

At this point, even Guy was feeling queasy watching the blatant sexual harassment. Just as he was about to speak, the door burst open and a familiar face walked in.

"Good afternoon, Teacher Hinds," Jo Way said as he walked in nonchalantly.

As Guy observed the self-important way in which Jo just burst into his supervisor's room, he felt the hair at the back of his neck stand upright.

'My face-slapping sense is tingling!'
