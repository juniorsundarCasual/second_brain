# Journal
- Went shopping at Lulu
- Tried building firmware for Pixhawk v5x, however it failed saying that the memory wasn't enough. 
	- It seems that adding all these changes has caused the size to balloon a little bit.
	- However, the build was successful for the Saluki V2. Need to test if the parameters are now editable for GPS and Magnetometer.
