# Definition
Nash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, a field that analyzes strategic decision-making in scenarios where multiple players' choices influence each other's outcomes.

It is reached when each player in a game has chosen a strategy, and no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. It's a "no regrets" situation â€“ given what others are doing, no one wishes they had done something different.

# Key Properties
- *Predictability* - We can predict the likely outcome of a game because no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy.
- *Not Always Optimal* - Doesn't guarantee the best possible overall outcome for everyone involved. Sometimes, cooperative strategies could yield better results for all players.

# Example - The Prisoner's Dilemma
The classic example of Nash Equilibrium is the Prisoner's Dilemma:
- Two suspects are arrested and kept in separate rooms.
- Each has the option to Confess or Remain Silent.
- If both Confess, they each get moderate sentences.
- If one Confesses and the other Remains Silent, the confessor goes free, and the silent one gets a harsh sentence.
- If both Remain Silent, they both get light sentences.
- The Nash Equilibrium in this scenario is for both to Confess, as that eliminates the risk of the worst outcome. However, cooperation (both remain silent) would be better for them overall.

# Applications
  Nash Equilibrium concepts appear in various fields:
- *Economics* - Analyzing market competition, pricing strategies, and negotiations.
- *Politics* - Understanding voting behaviors, international relations, and conflict resolution.
- *Biology* - Explaining evolutionary strategies among populations.
- *Computer Science* - Modeling network traffic and resource allocation
