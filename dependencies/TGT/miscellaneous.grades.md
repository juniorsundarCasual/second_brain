## Cultivation Methods

#### Common Grade

The Common methods are the lowest tiers. 

They are basic and can at most allow a mage to reach Core Formation Realm. They are basic as their contents touch on topics superficially, and hence the insights that can be gained from those methods are limited.

These work for 80-90% of the population.

#### Advanced Grade

Higher than Common method and can provide more insights. They are generally a continuation or expansion of Common methods and can usually carry the mage through their entire cultivation journey. Within the Common and Advanced tier, there are implicit subdivisions that depend on the specificity, relatability, applicability, and similar factors pertaining thot he method itself.


#### Specialised Grade

Tailored to specific individuals, bloodlines, physiques, or even species. Depending on the applicability, that is the number of people that can use the method, the cultivation methods can have a higher rarity.


#### Ancestral Grade

Passed down from generation to generation. These can be restricted to specific clans, sects or organisations. These are highly guarded and are passed down personally.


## Enchanted Weapons

#### Common Grade

Single enchantment.

#### Unique Grade

More than two enchantments.

#### Epic Grade

Can grow stronger over use.

#### Legendary Grade

Have psuedo-sentience, like a nascent will
