"T-They were here... B-But they're not here anymore," Kili said with a worried stutter and a stunned expression on her face.

"So how did you guys get separated?" Markus asked while massaging the little girls shoulder assuagingly.

"W-We had a battle-"

"You fought?!" Jean interjected while rushing forward to inspect Kili.

"It was just a mock battle," Kili tried to quickly doubled back to correct herself.

"Let the girl finish!" Marie bellowed. Her distress and anxiety was palpable as her voice strained and laced with a desperate urgency. She knelt in front of Kili, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and frustration, while her hands trembled as they gripped onto Kili's shoulders.

"Please," Marie half-begged and half-demanded. "Start from the beginning and don't leave a single detail out."

"W-Well we decided to play hide-and-seek..." Kili started. She then narrated the entire sequence of events to the best of her recollection and with as much detail and precision that she could muster. As she finished, a heavy air hung in the now thoroughly devastated meadow. At this point, all the members of the Sect had assembled in the area, even the guests Rianna and Shay-Hade.

"I've never seen or heard of an event like this before," Rianna declared while scratching her chin.

"I can't see anything," Elder Nara said with a grave frown. His eyes shimmered with a bright golden hue, clearly indicating that he was immersed in the powers of the Heavenly Eye.

The once composed and collected Marie was now pacing about haphazardly, occasionally pulling at her own hair in a worried manner. She closed her eyes, focused for a few seconds, and opened them, revealing a pair of golden pupils much like her Master.

"T-This can't be!" Marie exclaimed. "T-This can't be happening! It's not working!"

"What's going on?" Guy probed.

"The Heavenly Eye, it's..." Elder Nara measured his words carefully before admitting, "... it's blind. I can't see anything at all. The entire world is in flux. It's as though fate itself is reshuffling!"

"You never said this would happen!" Her eyes, bloodshot and filled with determination, bore into Elder Nara as she accused him with a raw intensity.

"Calm down, girl!" The usually calm Elder Nara snapped back forcefully, his voice echoing in the open field, causing Marie to take involuntary steps back in fear. "This is the first time for me too."

"Wait!" Markus called out from beside the hollowed tree. He stood there with a palm on the trunk and his eyes closed. "I can sense something here!"

He then picked up a rock from the ground and started to explain, "I can sense a disturbance in the fabric of spacetime in this location that didn't exist before."

"If I remove the standard gravitational pull of Gaea from this region," he said while creating a sphere of zero gravity around him. "If I then toss this rock in this location, it should move forward with a constant velcity (assuming air resistance is negligible)."

He lightly moved the rock before letting it go, causing it to move forward with a constant velocity. However instead of moving in a straight line, it started to curve slightly before spiralling towards a point beside the hollow tree.

"It's not just one," Markus expressed before tossing a rock in another direction. This too followed a similar behaviour of suddenly curving and spiralling towards a point.

"There's two... I don't know if I can call them singularities... let's say irregularities in spacetime that don't make physical sense. I am assuming that its either magic or some higher form of physical phenomenon that we don't know about," Markus theorised while massaging his chin thoughtfully.

"What use is that?!" Marie bellowed. "Do you know where Dora and Kano are?"

"I-I don't- Look its a start-" Markus tried to offer as an explanation, Marie's impatience flared again, cutting him off with a caustic tone. "A start? By the time you finish, who knows what will have happened to them-"

"You need to calm down," Elder Nara said with a dour drone. "You are accomplishing very little with being so agitated and flighty."

"That's easy for you to say!" Marie responded with a accusatory tinge in her voice. "I expressly learned to cultivate the Heavenly Eye so that I could keep my family safe. You assured me that I would have the power to do so, if I was willing to sacrifice something in return. But now, even when I am ready to sacrifice everything to save them, I am unable to do so. Because the damn power that was supposed to keep them safe isn't working."

Her frustration spilled over as she expressed the profound disappointment of not being able to rely on the power she had worked so hard to cultivate. The once serene and confident woman now exhibited a vulnerability that unsettled those around her.

"I think I have an explanation for what's happening here," Guy said cautiously. The surety in his tone captured the attention of all members present and they looked towards him attentively.

"Has anyone ever thought about the providence of the world we live in?" Guy asked, causing a groan to escape from Marie.

"Sect Leader Larks," Marie said exasperatedly. "I don't think this is the right time for a philosphical discussion."

Guy raised his hand snappily and gestured for Marie to quiet down. "Listen to your Master and calm down for a moment. Can't you see everyone is in the same emotional space as you. Look at Grace! She is even more helpless compared to you, but do you see her throwing a tantrum."

"She's just a child, Guy," Grace cut in sternly. "Let her grapple with the situation as she deems fit."

"That is extremely hypocritical of you, Grace," Guy admonished while shaking his head. "She is in a position of power and leadership, that comes with a set of responsibilities and expectation. Not losing her senses and acting out are part of it."

Guy paused to calm himself, but the stress from his side quest earlier which exposed him to the dangers that lay ahead was too much and his anger bubbled over, "The very future of this world and all who dwell in it is hanging in the balance here!"

Those words echoed in everyone's ears for the next minute. They didn't think the Sect Leader to be someone who made baseless declarations. So the most took his words as statements of fact, which in turn caused an aura of confusion and distress to bloom amongst the members present.

"Pay attention!" Guy expressed before letting the mana inside his core into the world. With his advancement, the sphere of influence of his mana grew wider, encompassing the entire destroyed meadow. The translucent mist of mana started to grow dimmer until all the light of the world was turned off. Then, amidst this darkness, spots of light grew visible, like stars in the vast, black canvas of outer space.

"That's a black hole!" Markus' voice cut through the silence. "I've seen it before."

The singularity he was referring to started to grow larger as though it was approaching them. Then, suddenly, from the center of the massive well of black that sucked everything, even light, extended four sets of tentacles. These were the same harbingers of demise that Tron showed Guy and Wei Zao. Guy recreated the same, devastating scenery from memory making sure to highlight the death, despair and desecration brought forth by these celestial abominations.

The gore was vivid as the mindless creatures spawning from these tentacles that dug into the many planets that dotted the galaxy attacked, eviscerated and consumed the living beings on the hospitable planets. The ones born from the slimy-green tentacles would either consume and melt their victims, or take a slower and repugnant route fo infesting their victims with uncountable illnesses and killing them from the inside. The creatures ejected from the red, thorny tentacles were direct in their slaughter, choosing to disembowel, eviscerate, impale, behead, mulch, or shred their opponents. One would wonder if their red shade was natural or the result of the many layers of blood coating them. The pink hellions that spawned from their similarly coloured, veiny tentacles were more devious sociopathic and sadistic in their mission to spread death. They would emasculate, skin and amputate their opponents live, indulging in sexual ultra-violence to elongate the pain and despair felt by their victims before finally giving the broken souls the sweet embrace of death. The purple beings coming out of the ethereally glowing purple tentacles were the most subtle, but probably most insidious in their quest to gift death to every being of the world. Their strategy involved attacking the mind - to sow madness and discord such that society itself collapsed from within and people tore themselves limb from limb.

Most of the Sect Members present heaved loudly and violently upon witnessing the scene before them. It was worse than the scariest dreams a sick mind could fathom.

"What is all this, Guy?!" Grace exclaimed, causing the scenes to halt and the darkness to dissipate. The mist of mana that hung all around them lifted.

"What are these creatures?" Elder Nara probed further.

"Very soon, this world will be attacked in a way similar to the one I showed you just now. Another world will collapse upon this one, bringing with it something akin to the madness you just witnessed earlier. It has already started, you see!" Guy expressed animatedly. His actions and behaviour started to grow wilder and evocative. "The end of the world is nigh!" He exclaimed. "And we need to be prepared!"

"Guy-" Grace interjected. "What does this have to do with Dora and Kano?"

"Huh?" Guy blurted out. The growing fanaticism in his eyes dissipated and he looked around blankly. "Umm..." he hummed.

"Guy..." Grace repeated more sternly.

"That's it!" Marie cut in with a tone of finality. She walked over to the hollow tree and placed both her hands on it. She closed her eyes and concentrated hard on her following words.

|Dora and Kano Reva, the twins.|

The world turned silent as Marie's words reverberated everywhere. "M-Marie!" Elder Nara yelled while walking over with a brisk pace.

|The twins are lost, maybe separated, maybe together. They are away from me, far or close by. But no matter where they are, they will remain safe and unharmed until they return to-|

Elder Nara immediately shut Marie's mouth and looked at her with morbid fear evident in his eyes.

"Girl! Just what have you done?!" He exclaimed with a defeated gasp.
