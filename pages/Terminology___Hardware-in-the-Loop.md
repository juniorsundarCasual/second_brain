# Definition
	- Technique used in development and test of complex real-time embedded systems. Integrates hardware components of the system with simulated environments, allowing system to interact with the simulations as if they were operating in the real-world.
- # Advantages and Disadvantages
	- ## Advantages
		- *Realistic* - Involves real hardware components, offering a more accurate understanding of how the software and hardware will interact in real-world conditions.
		- *Early Detection of Hardware-Related Issues* - It can reveal issues related to hardware-software integration, electrical faults, and hardware limitations early in the development cycle.
		- *Safety and Cheaper* - Significantly reduces the risk and cost associated with field testing, especially in scenarios that are risky, expensive, or difficult to replicate.
		- *Automation* - Supports automated testing, which can lead to more efficient and thorough testing processes, ensuring that a wide range of scenarios and conditions are covered.
		- *Quality and Reliability* - Improves the overall quality and reliability of the system.
	- ## Disadvantages
		- *Setup Cost and Complexity* - Can be expensive and complex, especially for high-fidelity simulations or when testing large and intricate systems.
		- *Limited by Simulation Fidelity* - Contingent on the accuracy of the simulation models. Inaccurate or incomplete models can lead to misleading test results.
		- *Potential for Overlooking Issues* - Can't fully replicate every real-world scenario, potentially leading to missed issues that might occur in actual deployment.
		- *Maintenance and Updation* - Models require regular maintenance and updates to reflect changes in the system, which can be resource-intensive.
		- *Hardware Availability* - Requires the availability of the actual hardware components, which can be a limitation, especially in early development stages or for systems with scarce or expensive components.
