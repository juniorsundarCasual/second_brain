# Definition
- Method of testing and validating code in a simulation environment to quickly and cost-effectively catch bugs and improve quality of the code. Typically conducted in the early stages of software development process.
- # Advantages and Disadvantages
	- ## Advantages
		- *Ubiquity* - Can be run on any standard desktop computer without requiring equipment or testbenches.
		- *Timeliness* - Since simulation is entirely software based, it can go faster than real-time.
		- *Efficiency* - Can test multiple modes and iterations at once.
		- *Continuity* - Can develop and test new features as they are being developed.
		- *Transferrability* - Can be shared accross different teams and organisations.
		- *Safety* - Simulations can be rerun if catastrophic failure happes, saving hardware.
	- ## Disadvantages
		- *Limited Realism* - Cannot perfectly replicate all aspects of the real-world environment, potentially leading to discrepancies between simulation and actual performance.
		- *Hardware Interactions* - SITL cannot accurately simulate the intricacies of hardware-software interactions, which might lead to undetected issues that only appear in later stages of testing with actual hardware.
		- *Computationally Intensive* - High-fidelity simulations can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power, especially for complex systems.
		- *Simulation Limitations* - Limited by the accuracy and completeness of the simulation models used. Developing and maintaining these models can be challenging.
