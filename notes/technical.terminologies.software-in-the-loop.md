# Definition

Method of testing and validating code in a simulation environment to quickly and cost-effectively catch bugs and improve quality of the code. Typically conducted in the early stages of software development process.

# Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages

1. **Ubiquity** - Can be run on any standard desktop computer without requiring equipment or testbenches.
2. **Timeliness** - Since simulation is entirely software based, it can go faster than real-time.
3. **Efficiency** - Can test multiple modes and iterations at once.
4. **Continuity** - Can develop and test new features as they are being developed.
5. **Transferrability** - Can be shared accross different teams and organisations.
6. **Safety** - Simulations can be rerun if catastrophic failure happes, saving hardware.

## Disadvantages

1. **Limited Realism** - Cannot perfectly replicate all aspects of the real-world environment, potentially leading to discrepancies between simulation and actual performance.
2. **Hardware Interactions** - SIL cannot accurately simulate the intricacies of hardware-software interactions, which might lead to undetected issues that only appear in later stages of testing with actual hardware.
3. **Computationally Intensive** - High-fidelity simulations can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power, especially for complex systems.
4. **Simulation Limitations** - Limited by the accuracy and completeness of the simulation models used. Developing and maintaining these models can be challenging.
