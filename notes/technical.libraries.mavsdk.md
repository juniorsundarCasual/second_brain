MAVSDK is a collection of libraries for various programming languages to interface with the MAVLink systems such as in drones, cameras or ground systems.

The libraries provides a simple API for managing one or more vehicles, providing programmatic access to vehicle information and telemetry, and control over missions, movement and other operations.

The libraries can be used onboard a drone on a companion computer or on the ground for a ground station or mobile device.

Currently, there is use-in-production support for:
- C++
- [[Python|technical.libraries.mavsdk.python]]
- Swift
- Java
