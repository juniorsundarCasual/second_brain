# Definition

Technique used in development and test of complex real-time embedded systems. Integrates hardware components of the system with simulated environments, allowing system to interact with the simulations as if they were operating in the real-world.

# Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages

1. **Realistic** - Involves real hardware components, offering a more accurate understanding of how the software and hardware will interact in real-world conditions.
2. **Early Detection of Hardware-Related Issues** - It can reveal issues related to hardware-software integration, electrical faults, and hardware limitations early in the development cycle.
3. **Safety and Cheaper** - Significantly reduces the risk and cost associated with field testing, especially in scenarios that are risky, expensive, or difficult to replicate.
4. **Automation** - Supports automated testing, which can lead to more efficient and thorough testing processes, ensuring that a wide range of scenarios and conditions are covered.
5. **Quality and Reliability** - Improves the overall quality and reliability of the system.

## Disadvantages

1. **Setup Cost and Complexity** - Can be expensive and complex, especially for high-fidelity simulations or when testing large and intricate systems.
2. **Limited by Simulation Fidelity** - Contingent on the accuracy of the simulation models. Inaccurate or incomplete models can lead to misleading test results.
3. **Potential for Overlooking Issues** - Can't fully replicate every real-world scenario, potentially leading to missed issues that might occur in actual deployment.
4. **Maintenance and Updation** - Models require regular maintenance and updates to reflect changes in the system, which can be resource-intensive.
5. **Hardware Availability** - Requires the availability of the actual hardware components, which can be a limitation, especially in early development stages or for systems with scarce or expensive components.
