collapsed:: true
	- Collected failing runs with gyro shifting for Samridha
	- Trimmed PPT and wrote a script
	- Fault injection is possible through QGroundControl GUI.
	- MAVLink connection is not necessary for HITL since it is possible through MAVSDK.
	- HITL not possible in new Gazebo
	- Meeting with Siva placed on tentative cancel until Siva finalises the tasks for himself.

			- Terminology
				- Normal Landing: Drone lands at specified spot according to mission
				- Safe Landing: Drone cannot land at specified landing spot, still functional (has free resources to execute workload)
				- Emergency Landing: Drone has a major failure so flight controller forces landing
			- Main tasks
				- Dataset and model selection
				- Replicating results: Using open-source data and code
				- Finetuning
				- Deployment and related tasks
			- Simplifying assumptions for early iteration
				- Functioning drone able to execute workloads
				- Operable camera
				- Camera pointing down
				- Clear, unblurred view, static position
				- Landing spot is within field of vision
				- Single drone
